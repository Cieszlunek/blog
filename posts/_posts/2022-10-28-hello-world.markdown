Welcome to my page! :)

Here you will find my blog posts (and, well, you are reading one of them now :D). I also write articles that I'll keep updating as needed. Once you read a blog post, you can assume that it won't be updated again.

As a programmer, I'll be sharing my knowledge and best practices on how to build a high-quality product that's easy to maintain. However, I won't just focus on technical skills, since it's tough to build an ideal product in a dysfunctional team.

I'm motivated to run this page because it gives me time and space to collect my thoughts. I enjoy learning from people who share their knowledge online for free, and now it's time for me to give something back to the internet.
