Welcome on my page :)

You will find here my blogposts (hah you are now reading one of them :D). I'm also writing here articles. I'm not going to update my posts, so once you read them you can assume that you will not find anything else in the same post. On the other hand, I'm going to actualize my articles. I'll inform about those changes in separate posts.

I'm programmer, so I'm going to write about programming stuff. I'm going to share with you my knowledge and good practices on how to build easy to maintain, high quality product. And I'm not going to focus only on technical skills here. It is hard to build ideal product in nonfunctional team.

My motivation to run this page is that I'll have time and space to collect my thoughts. I enjoy learning from peoples who are sharing their knowledge online for free. It's time to give something from me to the internet. Someday maybe I'll turn on ads on this page and earn some money hehe
