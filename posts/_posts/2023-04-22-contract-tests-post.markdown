Hi,

In my [BDD article]({% post_url /articles/2022-10-29-bdd %}), I mentioned contract tests. I have prepared an article about what they are, why they are important, and how they can help achieve faster deployments in microservices architecture while having more confidence that one deployment won't break any other application. Contract tests are a great technique that is a must-have. Please check out my new article on [Contract Tests]({% post_url /articles/2023-04-22-contract-tests %}).
